All relational databases share the same design principles:
entities/tables = what everything must be broken into
columns = attributes that describe the entity
primary key = what every entity has that uniquely identifies each row (can be shown in different tables to show a relationship)
a foreign key is a primary key represented in another table (they are the only repeated values allowed in the relational database)
ONLY three types of relationships between entities in a relational database: one to one, one to many, many to many
Normalazition is the series and principles/strategies that help refine database design. broken into 3 forms
